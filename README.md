### BACKLOG:

**Backlog Link**
[Jira Backlog](https://doylead.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/E71/boards/2/backlog?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZjliZTg5YmI3ZGY2NDljOWJjMmM3OTM2ZjNhNzVlNGMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9&cloudId=56827f1d-9c14-485c-8ee9-3e41b8b2df97&selectedIssue=E71-16)

**Order Rationale:** We picked these backlog items for the first sprint so that we would have a solid foundation for 
implementation of future features that the stakeholders required.

1. **Create user account:** This is essential for users to register their account and begin storing their 
recipes securely. This also facilitates future feature development by establishing account and recipe databases.
2. **Delete user account:** The user would like to be able to delete their account in an easily accessible way. This
promotes positive business practices and user autonomy.
3. **Add recipes:** After the user creates an account, the user needs to be able to add recipes to their recipe box.
This is a necessary function of the app.
4. **Secure recipes:** Ensures that users' recipes protected and accessible to their account. This maintains privacy
and security.
5. **Save recipes between sessions:** The user needs to be able to save their recipes and reliably access them every 
time they use the app.
6. **View recipe:** The user needs to be able to view their recipe in a format that is legible and accessible. This
allows the user to have a better cooking experience.
7. **Browse recipes:** The user also needs to be able to browse all of their stored recipes to improve usability.
8. **Delete a recipe:** The user may encounter a recipe that they did not like so the user needs to be able to delete
this recipe. The user should have control over their content.
9. **Edit a recipe:** The user needs to be able to modify the recipe in case of mistakes or updates. The helps with
flexibility and recipe accuracy.
10. **Tag recipe:** The user needs to be able to add tags to a recipe. This will make a future filter implementation
possible.
11. **Filter by recipe tags:** The user would like to filter their recipes by specific tags. This will make recipe 
organization and visibility a lot better.
12. **Filter by cook time:** The user wants to filter the recipe by cook time so that they do not pick complicated 
recipes to make on a busy week night.
13. **Annotate recipes:** The user wants to take notes on their recipe in order to accommodate preferences of people
that they may be cooking for.
14. **Share recipes:** The user next wants to share their recipes with their loved ones either by printing or email. 
    

### SPRINT PLANNING:
**Definition of Ready:**
- PBI has an estimated size (and it should be small)
- PBI is clearly articulated and not ambiguous
- PBI is expressed as a user story (“As a ______, I want ______ so that I can ______”)
- PBI has acceptance criteria
- All dependencies for PBI are known
- Developers have had the opportunity to ask questions




# SPRINT 1

### FORECAST

**Forecasted Number of Story Points:** 25

**Forecast Rationale:** We chose this number of story points based on skill levels, number of team members, and
scheduling impediments. Our stories are all very small so, as a team, we decided to try and tackle 25.5 points for our
first sprint. The primary impediment for our team is scheduling for mod programming sessions. We have 5 team members in
three separate time zones. We have currently committed meeting twice weekly for two hours with the caveat of augmenting 
as necessary to ensure minimum viable product by the end of the sprint.

**[Backlog Planning Evidence:](https://agilesoftwarecourse.slack.com/archives/C07TUEH8HFD/p1730938293987819?thread_ts=1730938222.647509&cid=C07TUEH8HFD)**
This is evidence that only developers participated in the sprint planning and move of PBIs into sprint.
