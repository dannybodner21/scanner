Attendees: Andrew, Danny, Mark, Veronica

Done:
* We have a working Django project!
* We created a very basic model for recipes
* We created a page where users could add recipes using Django's built-in forms*
* We created a page where users could view recipes based on our model*
* We persisted added recipes created to database
* These pages are, as they would say on The Great British Bakeoff, "Rough and Ready" with plenty of room for beautification.

TODO:
* Change redirect after adding a recipe to point to a the recipe just added (currently it cheats and always points to the same recipe)
* Add minimal formatting to recipe view page, including unit tests (e.g. ingredients as unordered list, steps as ordered lists)
* Add syntax hinting to add recipe form
